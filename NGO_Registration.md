# Pune AI Community: Public Trust Registration
-

## 1. Why Register a Public Trust?
- Creates a separate legal identity to:
  - Sign MoUs with PICT and other institutions
  - Open a bank account and receive sponsorships/donations
  - Protect and lock the name “Pune AI Community”
- Clearly aligned with public benefit: AI education, awareness, community building
- Only 2 trustees, none outside family → simplest permissible structure
- Lowest compliance among formal non-profit forms

Bottom line: A Public Charitable Trust is the fastest, cheapest, and safest structure for a small but credible AI community in Maharashtra.


## 2. Correct Legal Form
- Type: Public Charitable Trust  
- Governing Law: Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950  
- Authority: Charity Commissioner, Maharashtra (Pune region)


> Not a private trust (restricted beneficiaries)  
> Not a society (minimum 7 members required)  
> Not Section 8 company (heavy MCA & audit compliance)


## 3. Name (Critical)
✔ Pune AI Community  
✖ Pune Artificial Intelligence Community  

Why this matters
- Short, brandable, defensible
- Name protection achieved through:
  - Trust registration
  - Bank account
  - MoUs, invoices, event usage

⚠️ Name change later is legally painful, finalize now.


## 4. Objects of the Trust (Legally Safe & Flexible)
Objects must be charitable, public-focused, and non-profit in intent.

### Recommended Objects (Indicative)
- Promote education, awareness, research, and ethical use of Artificial Intelligence
- Organize meetups, workshops, seminars, hackathons, conferences
- Collaborate with educational institutions, industry, and public bodies
- Support students, developers, researchers, and the general public
- Publish educational material and conduct outreach programs

### Revenue-Generating but Charitable (Allowed)
Include this mandatory safety wording:
> “The Trust may carry out the above activities on a free or paid basis, including through sponsorships, event fees, or grants, provided that all income and surplus shall be applied solely towards the objects of the Trust and no portion shall be distributed to Trustees.”

❌ Avoid words like *business, commercial venture, profit-sharing, consulting for profit*.


## 5. Trustee Remuneration (Critical Clarification)
### What is NOT allowed
- Trustees taking:
  - Percentage of sponsorships
  - Revenue share
  - Profits or surplus
- Any wording implying private benefit

This can:
- Trigger Charity Commissioner objections
- Block or cancel 12A / 80G
- Risk deregistration

### What IS allowed (Safe & Legal)
Add this clause explicitly:
> “The Trustees shall ordinarily act in an honorary capacity. However, the Trust may pay reasonable remuneration, professional fees, or honorarium to any Trustee for services actually rendered to the Trust, provided such payment is:
> - Not linked to profits or surplus  
> - Approved by a majority of disinterested Trustees  
> - Properly recorded and taxed as per law.”

✔ Trustees may be paid like professionals, not owners  
✔ Subject to TDS and personal income tax


## 6. Flexibility for the Future (Without Violations)
You cannot convert a Public Trust into a business vehicle.  
But you can allow controlled evolution.

### Amendment Clause (Standard & Necessary)
> “The Trustees may amend, alter, or add to the Objects, Rules, or Regulations of the Trust, subject to prior approval of the Charity Commissioner and applicable laws.”

This allows:
- Refining activities
- Adding new charitable AI-related initiatives
- Governance updates


## 7. Pre-Registration Action Plan (Exact)
1. Finalize:
   - Trust name
   - Objects (1–2 pages, tight language)

| LLP / Pvt Ltd | Not charitable, tax-inefficient |

Best fit for Pune AI Community: ✅ Public Trust


## 15. Risk Checklist (Avoid These)
- Profit-sharing language

## 16. One-Line Execution Plan
> *Draft deed (safe clauses) → Notarize → Online upload → Charity Commissioner approval → PAN → Bank → MoUs → 12A/80G*
